# presentation-2019Q1
Hello, the topic of my presentation is a "Comparison of state management solutions for React"     
`(Slide - Presentation topic)`  
The component-based approach of React and other frontend frameworks like Vue and Angular has changed the way our web looks like today. One massive part of their success story is the way components communicate and share state with each other. This empowers the developer to create maintainable software by separating different parts of logic and state into dedicated components that pushes our future web.  
`(Slide - The component-based approach)`  
In this article I will present multiple state-of-the-art state management libraries  
`(Slide - What will be discussed)`  
In an application, state is the interface between your data from any kind of backend or local change and the representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend. State is able to keep the data of different components in sync because each state update will rerender all relevant components.

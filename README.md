# presentation-2019Q1
Hello, the topic of my presentation is a "Comparison of state management solutions for React"     
`(Slide - presentation topic)`  
The component-based approach of React and other frontend frameworks like Vue and Angular has changed the way our web looks like today. One massive part of their success story is the way components communicate and share state with each other. This empowers the developer to create maintainable software by separating different parts of logic and state into dedicated components that pushes our future web.

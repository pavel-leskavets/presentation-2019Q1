							Why do we need state at all In an application, state is the interface
							between your data from any kind of backend or local change and the
							representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend. State is
							able to keep the data of different components in sync because each
							state update will rerender all relevant components.

						<h3>Redux - a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
						<img src="./img/dan-abramov.jpg" alt="dan-abramov">
						<p>Redux was first released at June, 2015 by Dan Abramov</p>						
				</section>
				<section>
						Installation <pre><code>npm install --save redux</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
						<h3>Basic example</h3>
						<p>
								The whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.
								The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
								To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers.
						</p>
						<img src="./img/reducers.png" alt="reducer" id="reducer">							
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre><code>
	function counter(state = 0, action) {
		switch (action.type) {
			case 'INCREMENT':
				return state + 1
			case 'DECREMENT':
				return state - 1
			default:
				return state
		}
	}
				</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
							Instead of mutating the state directly, 
						  you specify the mutations you want to happen with 
						  plain objects called actions. Then you write a special 
						  function called a reducer to decide how every action 
							transforms the entire application's state.
					</p>							
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
							Actions are payloads of information that send data 
							from your application to your store. They are the only 
							source of information for the store. You send them to the 
							store using <pre><code> store.dispatch()</code></pre>
					</p>							
<pre><code>
	const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
		{
			type: ADD_TODO,
			text: 'Build my first Redux app'
		}
</code></pre>
					<p>
							Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a 
							type property that indicates the type of action being performed. 
							Types should typically be defined as string constants.
					</p>									
				</section>
				
					<section>
								<p>
										The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:
										You call store.dispatch(action).
										An action is a plain object describing what happened. For example:
								</p>								
<pre><code>
{ type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }
{ type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }
</code></pre>
								<p>
										You can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including 
										components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals.
								</p>

								<p>
										The root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.
										How you structure the root reducer is completely up to you. Redux ships with a combineReducers() helper 
										function, useful for “splitting” the 
										root reducer into separate functions that each manage one branch of the state tree.										
										Here's how combineReducers() works. Let's say you have two reducers, one for a list of 
										todos, and another for the currently selected filter setting:
								</p>								
					</section>
					<section>
<pre><code>function todos(state = [], action) {
	// Somehow calculate it...
	return nextState
	}
	
	function visibleTodoFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
	// Somehow calculate it...
	return nextState
	}
	
	let todoApp = combineReducers({
	todos,
	visibleTodoFilter
})
</code></pre>
					</section>

						<h3>Apollo Link State</h3>
						<p>
							Peggy Rayzis from Apollo implemented a library for managing local state as 
							well to avoid the necessity for using a state management library from above 
							when managing the state from the GraphQL Server in your app. 
						</p>									
					</section>
					<section>
<pre><code>export const mountWithApollo = (initialState, Component) => {
const cache = new InMemoryCache();
// define the initial Store
const defaultState = { todos: [] };
const stateLink = withClientState({
cache,
defaults: initialState ? initialState : defaultState
});
const client = new ApolloClient({
cache,
link: stateLink
});
return (
<ApolloProvider client={client}>
<Component />
</ApolloProvider>
);
};</code></pre>
						</section>
					<section>
						<p>
								From this point on you are able read from your local state by writing GraphQL queries 
								where each top level field includes the @client directive. 
								By appending this directive Apollo knows, that you want to fetch from your local state.
						</p>								
					</section>
					<section>
<pre><code>const TODO_QUERY = gql`
{
	todos @client {
		id
		title
		finished
	}
}`;</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
								If using Apollo with a GraphQL or REST server you can
								request those sources as well in one single request. When using 
								apollo-link-rest you can wrap an ordinary REST-resource to be 
								queried and mutated by GraphQL queries/mutations.
									The result of the query can be accessed with the Query-component
									of Apollo, that accepts a render-method like the Subscriber in Unstated 
									or the Consumer from the Context API.
